RULES
Modification Rules Manual
-------------------------
Supported operations (all keywords MUST be in CAPITALS):
 
Unconditional Rules:
  1. Assignment:
       key=value
     (Sets the tag <key> to <value> only if the tag already exists. If the tag does not exist, the rule is skipped.
      Note: '==' is reserved for conditionals.)
  2. Numeric Modification:
       key+=value   or   key-=value
     (Increments or decrements the numeric value of the tag <key> by <value>.
      If the tag does not exist, the rule is skipped.)
  3. ADD Operation:
       ADD <tag_key>=<value>
     (Adds the tag <tag_key> with the specified <value> only if it does not already exist.)
  4. REMOVE Operation:
       REMOVE <tag_key>
     (Removes the tag <tag_key> from the way if it exists.)
  5. UPDATE Operation:
       UPDATE <tag_key> TO <value>
     (Updates the tag <tag_key> to <value>. If the tag does not exist, it is created.)
 
Conditional Rules:
  Use the following syntax to combine conditions with THEN an action and optionally ELSE an alternate action:
       IF <cond1> [AND/OR <cond2> ...] THEN <action> [ELSE <alternate_action>]
  - Each condition can be one of:
         tag_key [==, !=, >=, <=, >, <] value
     OR, to check for the absence/presence of a tag:
         NOTEXISTS <tag_key>
         EXISTS <tag_key>
  - The THEN action and optional ELSE action can be any of the operations above (ASSIGN, INCREMENT, DECREMENT, ADD, REMOVE, UPDATE).
  Example:
       IF LANES>1 AND NOTEXISTS HEIGHT THEN ADD HEIGHT=5 ELSE UPDATE LANES TO 2
 
Frequency-based Execution:
  You can append a frequency specifier to any rule to have it applied only a fraction of the times.
  The syntax is:
       FREQ <numerator>/<denom>
  For example:
       UPDATE MAXSPEED TO 50 FREQ 0.5/1
  This means the update will be applied approximately 50% of the times. FREQ is applied to the WHOLE rule, not to specific IF/ELSE conditions
 
Notes:
 - All syntax (keywords and operators) must be written in CAPITALS where specified (e.g. IF, THEN, ELSE, ADD, REMOVE, UPDATE, EXISTS, NOTEXISTS, FREQ, AND, OR).
 - Frequency rules work with both unconditional and conditional operations.
